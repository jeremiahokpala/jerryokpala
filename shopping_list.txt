Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes the magnetosphere of the Earth, deflecting destructive solar winds.

The atmosphere of the Earth consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. A region's climate is governed by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans. In most areas severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs and greatly impacts life.

Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 380,000 km (1.3 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon always faces the Earth with the same side through tidal locking and causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.

Earth, like most other Solar System bodies formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas of the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have reached a population of 8 billion today. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted Earth's environment. Today, humanity's impact on Earth's climate, soils, waters, and ecosystems is unsustainable, threatening people's lives and causing widespread extinction of other life.[26]

Etymology
The Modern English word Earth developed, via Middle English, from an Old English noun most often spelled eor√∞e.[27] It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed as *er√æ≈ç. In its earliest attestation, the word eor√∞e was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin terra and Greek Œ≥·øÜ gƒì: the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself. As with Roman Terra/Tell≈´s and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a personified goddess in Germanic paganism: late Norse mythology included J√∂r√∞ ('Earth'), a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.[28]

Historically, earth has been written in lowercase. From early Middle English, its definite sense as "the globe" was expressed as the earth. By the era of Early Modern English, capitalization of nouns began to prevail, and the earth was also written the Earth, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as Earth, by analogy with the names of the other planets, though earth and forms with the remain common.[27] House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes "Earth" when appearing as a name (for example, "Earth's atmosphere") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the (for example, "the atmosphere of the earth"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as "what on earth are you doing?"[29]

Occasionally, the name Terra /Ààt…õr…ô/ is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others,[30] while in poetry Tellus /Ààt…õl…ôs/ has been used to denote personification of the Earth.[31] Terra is also the name of the planet in some Romance languages (languages that evolved from Latin) like Italian and Portuguese, while in other Romance languages the word gave rise to names with slightly altered spellings (like the Spanish Tierra and the French Terre). The Latinate form G√¶a or Gaea (English: /Ààd íiÀê.…ô/) of the Greek poetic name Gaia (ŒìŒ±·øñŒ±; Ancient Greek: […°√¢iÃØ.a] or […°√¢j.ja]) is rare, though the alternative spelling Gaia has become common due to the Gaia hypothesis, in which case its pronunciation is /Àà…°a…™.…ô/ rather than the more classical English /Àà…°e…™.…ô/.[32]

There are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth. From Earth itself comes earthly. From the Latin Terra comes terran /Ààt…õr…ôn/,[33] terrestrial /t…ôÀàr…õstri…ôl/,[34] and (via French) terrene /t…ôÀàriÀên/,[35] and from the Latin Tellus comes tellurian /t…õÀàl ä…ôri…ôn/[36] and telluric.[37]

Artist's impression of the early Solar System's protoplanetary disk, out of which Earth and other Solar System bodies formed
The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002
‚àí0.0004 Ga (billion years) ago.[38] By 4.54¬±0.04 Ga the primordial Earth had formed.[39] The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.[40]

Estimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger.[41] A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named Theia, collided with Earth.[42] It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.[43][44] Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 Ga, numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.[45]

After formation
Main article: Geological history of Earth

Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing.[47] Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets.[48] Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed.[49] In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity.[50] By 3.5 Ga, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.[51]

As the molten outer layer of Earth cooled it formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have been mafic in composition. The first continental crust, which was more felsic in composition, formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust. The presence of grains of the mineral zircon of Hadean age in Eoarchean sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as 4.4 Ga, only 140 Ma after Earth's formation.[52] There are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance:[53] (1) a relatively steady growth up to the present day,[54] which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the Archean, forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists,[55][56] which is supported by isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary rocks. The two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale recycling of the continental crust, particularly during the early stages of Earth's history.[57]

New continental crust forms as a result of plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart. At approximately 750 Ma, one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia at 600‚Äì540 Ma, then finally Pangaea, which also began to break apart at 180 Ma.[58]

The most recent pattern of ice ages began about 40 Ma,[59] and then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3 Ma.[60] High- and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years.[61] The Last Glacial Period, colloquially called the "last ice age", covered large parts of the continents, up to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended about 11,700 years ago.[62]

Chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose.[64] The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere.[65] The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes.[66] True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface.[67] Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia,[68] biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland,[69] and remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[70][71] The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms.[72][73]

During the Neoproterozoic, 1000 to 539 Ma, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed "Snowball Earth", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.[74][75] Following the Cambrian explosion, 535 Ma, there have been at least five major mass extinctions and many minor ones.[76][77] Apart from the proposed current Holocene extinction event, the most recent was 66 Ma, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but largely spared small animals such as insects, mammals, lizards and birds. Mammalian life has diversified over the past 66 Mys, and several million years ago an African ape gained the ability to stand upright.[78] This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day.[79]

Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40%.[80] Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100‚Äì900 million years.[81][82] The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.[83] Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach 100 ¬∞C (212 ¬∞F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years.[84] Even if the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.[84][85]

The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 billion years. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi), about 250 times its present radius.[80][86] Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU (250 million km; 160 million mi) from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius, otherwise, with tidal effects, it may enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.[80]

Earth topological map, the area is redder if it is raised higher in real-life
The shape of Earth is nearly spherical, with an average diameter of 12,742 kilometers (7,918 mi), making it the fourth largest of the Solar System's planetary sized objects and largest among its terrestrial ones. Due to Earth's rotation its shape is bulged around the Equator and slightly flattened at the poles,[87] resulting in a 43 kilometers (27 mi) larger diameter at the equator than at the poles.[88] Earth's shape therefore is more accurately described as an oblate spheroid.

Earth's shape furthermore has local topographic variations. Though the largest variations, like the Mariana Trench (10,925 meters or 35,843 feet below local sea level),[89] only shortens Earth's average radius by 0.17% and Mount Everest (8,848 meters or 29,029 feet above local sea level) lengthens it by only 0.14%.[n 6][91] Earth's surface is farthest out from Earth's center of mass at its equatorial bulge, making the summit of the Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador (6,384.4 km or 3,967.1 mi) the farthest point.[92][93][94] Parallel to the rigid land topography the Ocean exhibits a more dynamic topography.[95]

To measure the local variation of Earth's topography, geodesy employs an idealized Earth producing a shape called a geoid. Such a geoid shape is gained if the ocean is idealized, covering Earth completely and without any perturbations such as tides and winds. The result is a smooth but gravitational irregular geoid surface, providing a mean sea level (MSL) as a reference level for topographic measurements.[96]

Surface
Further information: Land, Ocean, and Sea

Earth's surface is mainly ocean water.
The total surface area of Earth is about 510 million km2 (197 million sq mi).[15] Earth's surface can be divided into two hemispheres, such as into the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, or the Western and Eastern Hemisphere.

Most of the surface is made of water, in liquid form or in smaller amounts as ice. 70.8% (361.13 million km2 (139.43 million sq mi)) of the Earth's surface consists of the interconnected ocean,[97] making it Earth's global ocean or world ocean.[98][99] This makes Earth, along with its vibrant hydrosphere a water world[100][101] or ocean world,[102][103] particularly in Earth's early history when the ocean is thought to have possibly covered Earth completely.[104] The world ocean is commonly divided into the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean and Arctic Ocean, from largest to smallest. Below the ocean's surface are the continental shelf, mountains, volcanoes,[88] oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus, abyssal plains, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system.

In contrast, Earth's land makes 29.2%, or 148.94 million km2 (57.51 million sq mi) of Earth's surface area. Earth's land consists of many islands around the globe, but mainly of four continental landmasses, which are from largest to smallest: Afroeurasia,America, Antarctica and Australia.[105][106][107] These landmasses are further broken down and grouped into the continents. The terrain varies greatly and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms. The elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of ‚àí418 m (‚àí1,371 ft) at the Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude of 8,848 m (29,029 ft) at the top of Mount Everest. The mean height of land above sea level is about 797 m (2,615 ft).[108]

The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors.[109] Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust.[110] The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and olivine.[111] Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.[112]

Erosion and tectonics, volcanic eruptions, flooding, weathering, glaciation, the growth of coral reefs, and meteorite impacts are among the processes that constantly reshape Earth's surface over geological time.[113][114] The pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's continental surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. The total arable land is 10.9% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland.[115][116] Close to 40% of Earth's land surface is used for agriculture, or an estimated 16.7 million km2 (6.4 million sq mi) of cropland and 33.5 million km2 (12.9 million sq mi) of pastureland.[117]

Tectonic plates

Earth's major plates, which are:[118]
  Pacific Plate  African Plate[n 7]  North American Plate  Eurasian Plate  Antarctic Plate  Indo-Australian Plate  South American Plate
Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur.[119] The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.[120]

As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than 100 Ma old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be 200 Ma old.[121][122] By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is 4,030 Ma,[123] although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within Eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to 4,400 Ma, indicating that at least some continental crust existed at that time.[52]

The seven major plates are the Pacific, North American, Eurasian, African, Antarctic, Indo-Australian, and South American. Other notable plates include the Arabian Plate, the Caribbean Plate, the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between 50 and 55 Ma. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of 75 mm/a (3.0 in/year)[124] and the Pacific Plate moving 52‚Äì69 mm/a (2.0‚Äì2.7 in/year). At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the South American Plate, progressing at a typical rate of 10.6 mm/a (0.42 in/year).[125]

Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohoroviƒçiƒá discontinuity.[128] The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometers (3.7 mi) under the oceans to 30‚Äì50 km (19‚Äì31 mi) for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates.[129]

Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and 660 km (250 and 410 mi) below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core.[130] Earth's inner core may be rotating at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1‚Äì0.5¬∞ per year, although both somewhat higher and much lower rates have also been proposed.[131] The radius of the inner core is about one-fifth of that of Earth. Density increases with depth, as described in the table on the right.

Among the Solar System's planetary sized objects Earth is the object with the highest density.

Chemical composition
See also: Abundance of elements on Earth
Earth's mass is approximately 5.97√ó1024 kg (5,970 Yg). It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminum (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to mass segregation, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.[132]

The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.[133][132]

Heat

Global map of heat flow from Earth's interior to the surface
The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232.[134] At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000 ¬∞C (10,830 ¬∞F),[135] and the pressure could reach 360 GPa (52 million psi).[136] Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately 3 Gyr, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.[137][138]

The mean heat loss from Earth is 87 mW m‚àí2, for a global heat loss of 4.42√ó1013 W.[139] A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes, a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock. These plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts.[140] More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges. The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents.[141][200~Do all these using git on the command line!

Create a folder on the command line and turn it into a Git project.
Create a file called ‚Äústory.txt‚Äù in your project. Add a lot of text inside.
Add another file called ‚Äúshopping_list.txt‚Äù to the project, and write down what you need from the store (or just many rows of text).
Create a subfolder called ‚Äúschool‚Äù into the project, and create a file called ‚Äútools.txt‚Äù inside. You will need these files in the future exercises.
After doing all the changes described above, create a total of three commits: one, where you add the story, a second on where you add the shopping list, and a third one where you add the school folder. Make sure that each commit message is truly descriptive.
Using the command ‚Äúgit log‚Äù, check that you have properly created three commits.
Add something new to the shopping list, and create another commit. Use the command ‚Äúgit add -p‚Äù.
Make sure you can see all the commits in the output of ‚Äúgit log‚Äù.
If you see the following message when creating a commit error: cannot run : No such file or directory error: unable to start editor, make sure you configured the default text editor of Git properly (go back to exercise 2).

To submit, give all the commands used in the exercise.~
